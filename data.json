A few minutes later someone walked up beside the guy that ordered the steak while he was reading the menu. Thinking that the person that walked up beside him was the waiter, he asked, \"Do you have my roundhouse yet?\". He looked up and saw that Chuck Norris was right beside him. Chuck Norris said, \"You bet your ass I do!\". Chuck Norris then roundhouse kicked the guy in the face and asked, \"How did that taste?\"."}
