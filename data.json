The Big Bang measured at 2 CNRKs, so far the only thing to certainly be more powerful than 1 CNRK. The Tsar Bomb, though, measured at a puny 0.0000327581 CNRKs, and the MOAB at 0.0000000000000000476738295873826782 CNRKs. The regular blink of a regular eye measured at an extremely puny 0.00000000000000000000000[insert 1000 zeroes here]6783758684 CNRKs."}
