By the way, only Vol. 13 is in less than 10 libraries. Why? It only contains a picture of Chuck Norris performing a roundhouse kick, which in turn roundhouse-kicks the reader. Few did not need to go to the hospital AND lived. Most of the others survived due to a trip to the hospital. The other readers died due to the picture."}
